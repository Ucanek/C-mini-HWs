 * ---------------
 * Your task is to implement four different functions, each taking only one
 * argument - an integer.
 * Functions times_3, minus_8 and plus_5 do such arithmetic operations as
 * stated in their names, returning result as an integer.
 * Function say_number prints exactly (!) "number is x\n" to the output,
 * where 'x' is the input argument for the function.
 * 
 * Once you're done with your functions, do not forget to uncomment
 * function calls in main() function to test your solution.
