 * ---------------
 * Your task is to implement the three following functions. First two functions
 * are very simple, just to lead you to the solution of the third one.
 *
 * The point of this task is to help you understand pointer dereference better.
 *
 * Advice: do not skip this task even if you are tempted. It will really
 * help you understand this very important concept of pointer dereference.
 * If you get stuck, try deleting the code and write the function again
 * from scratch.
 *
 * Function 1: pointer_jump
 * This function takes pointer to a pointer as only argument and returns its
 * dereference. In other words - returns the pointer to which points
 * the pointer passed in the argument.
 *
 * Function 2: pointer_doublejump
 * Let's take it a step further. This function takes in pointer to a pointer to
 * a pointer and should return its double dereference. In other words - returns
 * the pointer to which points the pointer to which points the pointer passed
 * in the argument.
 *
 * Function 3: pointer_jumper
 * Let's take it even further. This functions takes in pointer to an array of
 * pointers and a "goal" pointer. Each of the pointers (passed to this
 * function) points to some other pointer in the same array.
 * Example:
 *
 *                #########################################
 *                # 5 # 4 # 8 # 1 # 6 # 2 # 7 # 0 # 9 # 3 #
 *                #########################################
 *
 * Field 0 points to field 5, field 1 points to field 4, field 2 points to
 * field 8, ...
 *
 * The goal of the function is to start at the first element and return the
 * number of jumps (dereferences), before the goal pointer is reached.
 *
 * If the function was called on the example specified above and the goal
 * pointer would be 9, the number of jumps would be 4 (0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 8 -> 9).
 *
 *
 * DO NOT modify main function, your task is only to implement aforementioned
 * functions.
