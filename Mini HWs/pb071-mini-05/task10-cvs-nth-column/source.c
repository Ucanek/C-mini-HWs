 * Minihomework 05: CVS n-th column

 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Your task is:
 *  1) to read the following information from the stdin (separated by
 *  newline):
 *      - line with a number of rows _k_
 *      - line with an index _n_ of column (starting at 0)
 *      - line(s) of CSV-like data (cvs "1", values separated by commas),
 *      so-called "rows"
 *
 *  2) for each in _k_ rows, print its _n_-th column (and newline).
 *
 * You can assume that input has at least _k_ rows of _n_ columns (the _k_ and
 * _n_ lines excluded).
 *
 * Read only MAX_LINE_LEN characters from each line, discard the others.
 *
 * Write your code directly into main method, create your own auxiliary
 * functions if you find them useful.
 *
 * cvs 1 NO advanced features of
 * [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) (such as enclosing in `"`)
 * or any other standard will be tested
