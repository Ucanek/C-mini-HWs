 * Minihomework 07: Structured students

 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Your assignment in this task is to create a simple program that will
 * collect and aggregate info about N students.
 *
 * Firstly, you have to parse the input file into student_info structs
 * with get_input function.
 *
 * Afterward you need to count the number of males, females and repeating
 * students with aggregate function. You should save this info into
 * subject_statistics struct.
 *
 * Statistics will then be printed out by pretty_print function.
 *
 * The input file is structured as follows:
 *  - first line contains only 1 number N, representing how many students are
 *    going to be processed.
 *  - next lines contain info about N students (each value on separate line):
 *    - uco (unsigned int)
 *    - sex (one char 'M' or 'F'), you should use the provided enum sex_t
 *    - whether the student is repeating (one char 'T' or 'F')
 *
 * Example:
 *   2
 *   445700
 *   M
 *   F
 *   999999
 *   F
 *   T
 *
 * - Output for this example should be:
 *   "Subject code: PB071\n"
 *   "The number of male students: 1\n"
 *   "The number of female students: 1\n"
 *   "The number of repeating students: 1\n"
 *
 * You can (have to) modify all functions and structs marked with TODO
