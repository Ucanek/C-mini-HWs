 *
 * Your task is to implement function 'calculate_salaries' which calculates
 * the total sum of salaries the company has to pay out to its employees.
 * The function takes timesheet_t struct, which contains a number of employees 
 * and an array of employees' time reports (struct employee_t - contains hourly 
 * salary + reported hours).
 * 
 * Rules:
 *      - if an employee earned 10 000 or less that month, he gets the whole
 *          amount (count the whole amount)
 *      - if an employee earned more than 10 000 that month, he pays 15% tax
 *          (count whole amount - 15%)
 * 
 * There is 'load_timesheet' function provided for you which loads the
 * timesheet from stdin.
 * 
 * The input has the following structure:
 *      <number of employees>
 *      <hourly salary> <hours>
 *      <hourly salary> <hours>
 *      ...
 * 
 * So for example, if we want to load a timesheet with 2 employees (first has
 * hourly salary 10 and worked 2 hours, second has salary 250 and worked 180
 * hours), the input has to have the following structure:
 * 
 *      2
 *      10 2
 *      250 180
 *
 *      and the total sum of salaries will be (10*2) + 0,85*(250*180) = 38450
 *
 * If the salary after extracting tax is not an integer, convert it and ignore
 * the floating-point part (this is not clean and NEVER do it in homeworks,
 * but it makes the implementation easier).
 *
 * You can do your own testing with compiled binary, just follow the
 * instructions after executing it.
 *
 * Do not change anything else except function calculate_salaries.
