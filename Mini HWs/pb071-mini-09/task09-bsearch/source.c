 *
 * In this exercise your task is to use the 'bsearch' function from <stdlib.h>
 * to find similar movie characters.
 *
 * Each character has a name, race and the movie it appeared in (see the
 * 'character' struct). For each of the latter two attributes, you need to implement
 * a comparing function (if the two given instances have the attribute of the
 * same value, return 0, positive if the first is bigger, negative otherwise).
 *
 * Finally, complete the main function with calls to your implemented code.
